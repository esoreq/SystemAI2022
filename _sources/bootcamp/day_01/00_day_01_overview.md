# DAY 01 - basics

Controlling the fundamentals is critical in any field, but especially in data science.
Today, I'll go over five essential fundamentals in modern data science.

1. Getting a Sense of the Linux Environment
2. Establishing a reproducible computational environment
3. Using version control to curate your work
4. Using Jupyter notebook to document your work
5. Using Markdown to document your projects


## Before We Begins

## Introductions

Hello everyone and welcome to the Data Science Bootcamp. I am Dr Eyal Soreq, your instructor for this course. During this course, you will learn how to apply modern data science methods to neurocognitive issues, including how to create reusable data-driven reports using the GWDG Jupyter cloud. The course aims to teach you some of the analytical skills you need to complete your PhD.

### Getting to know each other

Let's go over all the people that are in this boot camp, 
If you can: 
- Say your full name
- Your scientific background 
- Your programming background 
- And why they would like to become neuroscientists


### Advice On Benefiting The Most From The Course

Aside from wishing you a warm welcome, I want to share some helpful tips for completing this course. At this point, you should have a lot of experience with online courses. Online courses, in my opinion, require different skills from students and provide a new way of studying. Being an online learner means you must be self-motivated and disciplined. Consequently, it's your responsibility to establish and maintain a regular study schedule.

### Collaborate And Share Ideas, Code, Examples Etc

A key factor for course success is completing all assignments. Collaboration with your classmates is not only permitted, but I encourage it. Getting a deeper understanding of something is best achieved by successfully teaching it to someone else. Even so, you will find that the course is designed in such a way that each assignment is personalized.

### Ask Questions

I canâ€™t stress this enough, you are in your very first steps in what I hope will become a fruitful career. However, you will soon find that in most cases, the technical, programmatic and even theoretical problems you encounter are not unique. Learn from other people experience.

### Know When To Give Up And Ask For Help

When you search online for more than 15 minutes and get no relevant result, you might be asking the wrong questions. If you spend more than an hour trying to solve a problem using online sources and nothing works, it might be useful to ask a friend, a supervisor, or collaborator.

### Feedback

As you know, the course also has a [blackboard site](https://virtualcampus.maxplanckschools.org/course/view.php?id=153#section-1). Please give us feedback on how to improve the course, it will benefit you immediately.
We also have a slack workspace to make interactions more simple. 
Please use it to ask questions give feedback and in general share you successes and failures - sometimes sharing the right error is a step away from solving the problem. 

### What Will be covered

Our focus in this five-day course is to learn how to use [gwdg Jupyter-cloud](https://jupyter-cloud.gwdg.de/welcome/) as your primary analytical tool. This first day is all about taking control over your scientific environment. 

If there is a specific topic you would like me to cover or expand on, please let me know by leaving a comment on the feedback section of the blackboard site or the slack channel.
This  course's content is dynamically generated from notebooks using a framework called jupyter-book, so if possible,  I'll simply add a response to your questions in  tomorrow's session.
If I believe that a response in the slack channel would be better served, I may do so as well.
In general, if you are on the Slack channel and know how to assist a friend, please do so.
If I think this is a great response, I'll just smile (and tag a smile) and move on.
If, on the other hand, I believe the answer is incomplete, I will share my thoughts with you, and you will gain some knowledge as well, and we will discuss the subject.
Finally, one of the best aspects of academia is that it is the only place where you are required to constantly learn.
If you believe there is a better way to accomplish something in my examples, please share your thoughts with me and your classmates.
