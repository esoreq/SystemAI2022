    "## Installing packages and modules from PyPI\n",
    "- The most common usage of pip is to install from the Python Package Index using a requirement specifier. \n",
    "- The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPI and also known as the Cheese Shop, is the official third-party software repository for Python. \n",
    "- Some package managers, including pip, use PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies.\n",
    "- If you create an anconda environment you can use pip to install the specific packages into the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what about the dependencies \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a package manager such as Anaconda makes it easy to install almost any additional package. \n",
    "- Moreover, it simplifies collaboration by sending a jupyter notebook with a special file called `.yml` as you should recal from day one of this boot camp\n",

    "- Here is how you set up your environment for the this course using a `.yml` file \n",
    "- Create a new python notebook and name it `setup_SYS_2022.ipynb`\n",
    "- It is up to you to decide what text to include in your markdown cells to remind yourself why you do what you do\n",
    "- This is an introductory course so we are much simpler ðŸ˜Š\n"
