    "# DAY 04 - Numpy and Pandas 101\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need modules?\n",
    "- Modules are simply a time-saving method of combining multiple pieces of useful functionality that serve a similar purpose. \n",
    "- When a module can be easily disassociated from the larger programme, it is much simpler for a scientist to understand what they should anticipate receiving from that module.\n",
    "- In addition to this, they are an effective method of working together toward the same goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The scientific Python ecosystem\n",
    "- Consider the image below that illustrates the scientific eco-system that is based on Python \n",
    "- At the core level we have three tools we already used extensively\n",
    "  - Anaconda for managing our environment \n",
    "  - Jupyter as our notebook framework that enables both documenting code and running it in the same time \n",
    "  - And under the hood we used the IPython which stands for interactive Python that powers our kernel \n",
    "  - Today we will extend our reach to cover two and half additional players, specifically Numpy and Pandas, with some backstage support from Matplotlib, which we will cover extensively tomorrow.  \n",
    "![](../../images/eco_system.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)?\n",
    "- Pandas is Pythons basic data analytics package that provides quick, versatile, and expressive data structures that make dealing with \"relational\" or \"labelled\" data straightforward. \n",
    "- It's a high-level building component for real-world Python data analysis. \n",
    "- It is probably the most powerful and useful open source data analysis/manipulation tool for small to mid size datasets (10 to 10 million rows give or take).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)?\n",
    "- Numpy is Pythons basic scientific computing package that provides several essential capabilities such as: \n",
    "  - Multidimensional array object, \n",
    "  - Derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), \n",
    "  - Routines for fast array operations, including: \n",
    "    - mathematical, \n",
    "    - logical, \n",
    "    - shape manipulation, \n",
    "    - sorting, \n",
    "    - selecting, \n",
    "    - I/O (i.e. input/output), \n",
    "    - discrete Fourier transforms, \n",
    "    - basic linear algebra, \n",
    "    - basic statistical operations, \n",
    "    - random simulation, \n",
    "    - and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Matplotlib\n",
    "- In Python, Matplotlib is the \"grandfather\" of data visualization. \n",
    "- It was created to try and replicate MATLAB's plotting capabilities with Python. \n",
    "- It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for creating reproducible publication ready scientific figures.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Some of the major Pros of Matplotlib are:\n",
    "  * Simple plots are generally easy to create\n",
    "  * Each element in the figure is nicely controlled\n",
    "  * A variety of output formats with high quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this module will cover\n",
    "- Today's main objective is to familiarize you with the core scientific packages in the Python eco-system.\n",
    "- We will start by looking over the different Numpy and Pandas data structures\n",
    "  - How to create them \n",
    "  - How to use them \n",
    "  - And how to save them \n",
    "- Then focus on Numpy and go over some advanced functionalities \n",
    "- Return to Pandas to explore some basic and advanced data capabilities   \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Links to expand your understanding \n",

    "For those interested in learning more...\n",
