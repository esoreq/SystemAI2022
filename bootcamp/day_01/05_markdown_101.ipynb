    "The Markdown formatting process requires you to use syntax to apply various formatting, such as **bold text** or *italics*.\n",

    "1. Use a simple naming convention \n",
    "    `[#]_[notebook_description]_[author_initials]_[YYYY-MM-DD].ipynb`\n",
    "    - `#` The number of notebooks in an analysis can be very large, and clustering notebooks together with an identifying symbol makes it easier to keep track of what you tried.  \n",
    "    - `notebook_description` is just a short description of what this notebook is about, e.g. `exploratory_analysis`,  `pre_processing`, `FIR_FC_mining` or `final_report`. \n",
    "    - `author_initials` Is essential when working together with collaborators using a joint repository or when sending over your work to a supervisor.\n",
    "    - `Date` Could take any form but is the simplest way of keeping track of what you did \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include a meaningful introduction (H1 header) that describes the notebooks purpose and content.\n",
    "1. Make your notebook's headings and documentation in markdown cells clear and concise. Tell people about your workflow steps and consider how it might benefit you in the future.\n",
    "1. Refactor and outsource code into modules. Every time you copy and paste a piece of code, you should consider replacing it with a function. This will not only make your notebook more readable, but also make fixing errors easier.\n",
