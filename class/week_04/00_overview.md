# WEEK 04

## Machine learning for medical imaging: methodological failures and recommendations for the future

### High risk field 
- The stakes are high for any machine learning model that attempts to provide a clinical tool. 
- It can take up to 30 years for a model to translate into a clinical practice (for example cardiovascular MR prediction)
- When we define high risk we also imply transparent models 
- Black box vs white/glass box models 
- What is the need 
- Why is it important 
- What is the potential impact
- How do you evaluate success? 

### Stakeholders 
- Who will be affected 
- How will this change practices 

### Usage in the real world 
- What do we need to do to make stake holders adapt our tools? 
- What kind of training do you need to develop

### Itâ€™s not all about larger datasets (but... )
- The challenge is both legal and ethical 
- But also quality dataset are hard to create 

### Improper evaluation procedures and leakage
- How is the model evaluated 
- How are we protecting from potential bias 

### Benchmarks are hard to develop
- Why do we need benchmarks?
- Validation should be unbiased and independent with multi-sites
