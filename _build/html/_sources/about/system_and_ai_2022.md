# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my Systems & AI course. Which is a fancy way of saying "introduction to data science." I'm Eyal Soreq, and I'm a research scientist at Imperial College in London. I spend most of my time working on ways to extract knowledge from various behavioural measures from various sources, such as continuously monitored motion sensors in a house or large electronic health records spanning a person's life. My PhD research focused on the functional connectivity architecture of working memory and intelligence, which is a fancy way of saying that I looked into how different parts of the brain interact when we perform a cognitive task. Because I'm going by first names with everyone in the class, you can call me Eyal. If you have any questions or concerns about the class, please post them on the slack workspace, either privately to me on the appropriate day, or anonymously using openLMS or Tomoko. You may also interrupt me with questions. The goal of this class is to give you the hands-on experience you'll need to apply machine learning successfully in your PhD. It complements but does not replace a traditional Machine Learning course. Some things may be redundant for those of you who have taken or are taking a machine learning class, but I hope there will be some new material in this course as well.

## What we will cover

During this course, you will learn how to apply modern data science methods to cognitive metrics, including how to clean and transform real datasets, create reusable data-driven reports, apply machine learning concepts to datasets to answer questions. The course goal is to provide you with some of the broader analytical skills you need to complete your PhD. This is a baseline course, it assumes no prior Python knowledge and for those of you which this is not true this might be frustrating. My suggestion is to use this opportunity to refine you skills by either challenging yourself during the course, or by providing mentorship to those who are struggling teaching a topic is the best way to master it.

## The course had a boot camp session

We just finished a boot camp session that gave some baseline guides and syntax on how to use Python and it's ecosystem. The material is there and if you feel that you need a refresher it is contained in a self-pace manner.

## We also have reading material

I selected some papers that are supposed to give some context to the different parts of the course. We will go over these at the beginning of each session in a format of a journal club - however I urge you to read those in advance.  

| Session | paper |
| --- | --- |
| week 01 | [The Costs of Reproducibility](../papers/The%20Costs%20of%20Reproducibility.pdf) |
| week 02 | [Unsupervised learning in images and audio to produce neural receptive fields](../papers/Unsupervised%20learning%20in%20images%20and%20audio%20to%20produce%20%20neural%20receptive%20fields.pdf) |
| week 03 | [The roles of supervised machine learning in systems neuroscience](../papers/The%20roles%20of%20supervised%20machine%20learning%20in%20systems%20neuroscience.pdf) |
| week 04 | [Machine learning for medical imaging](../papers/Machine%20learning%20for%20medical%20imaging.pdf) |
| week 05 | [Machine Learning for Precision Psychiatry](../papers/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Precision%20Psychiatry.pdf) |

## 2 1/2 hours is not long

We have very little time to cover many topics. All the sessions will begin with a short journal club and high-level context on the sessions topic. This will be followed by a long lab session where you will be separated into four breakout rooms, where you will go over a self-paced lab on the topic.
