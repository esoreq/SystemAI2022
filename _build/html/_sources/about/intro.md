# BOOT CAMP

## Introductions

Hello everyone and welcome to the Data Science Bootcamp. I am Dr Eyal Soreq, your instructor for this course. During this course, you will learn how to apply modern data science methods to neurocognitive issues, including how to clean and transform real datasets, create reusable data-driven reports, apply machine learning concepts to datasets to answer questions. The course goal is to provide you with some of the broader analytical skills you need to complete your PhD. This is a baseline course, it assumes no prior Python knowledge and for those of you which this is not true this might be frustrating. My suggestion is to use this opportunity to refine you skills by either challenging yourself during the course, or by providing mentorship to those who are struggling teaching a topic is the best way to master it. 

## Advice On Benefiting The Most From The Course

Aside from wishing you a warm welcome, I want to share some helpful tips for completing this course. At this point, you should have a lot of experience with online courses. Online courses, in my opinion, require different skills from students and provide a new way of studying. Being an online learner means you must be self-motivated and disciplined. Consequently, it's your responsibility to establish and maintain a regular study schedule.

## The course has a slack workspace and a virtual campus site 

- This is a PhD level course - this means that it welcomes discussion on topic 
- As you know, the course has an [Open LMS site](https://virtualcampus.maxplanckschools.org/course/view.php?id=153#section-1). 
- To provide more modern platform (which will allow me and others to create discussion more easily) I created a slack workspace
  - To Join Go to [slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace) and create a slack account 
  - Use your max placnk email please for the account 
  - Then go to the course workspace and ask to [join](https://join.slack.com/t/max-planckworkspace/signup)

### Feedback

- Please give feedback on how to improve the course, it will benefit you immediately.
- You can either do this anonymously via Open LMS, or using the slack channel 
- Remember one of the hardest things to do once you know something is to understand what is clear and what isn't 
- Asking for clarifications is a sign of strength not weakness, and anything you ask (within reason) can be addressed either by providing links to specialised content or by providing simple explanations in the course notes (or sometimes both) 


### Collaborate And Share Ideas, Code, Examples Etc

A key factor for course success is completing all assignments. Collaboration with your classmates is not only permitted, but I encourage it. Getting a deeper understanding of something is best achieved by successfully teaching it to someone else. Even so, you will find that the course is designed in such a way that each assignment is personalized.

### Ask Questions

I can’t stress this enough, you are in your very first steps in what I hope will become a fruitful career. However, you will soon find that in most cases, the technical, programmatic and even theoretical problems you encounter are not unique. Learn from other people experience.

### Know When To Give Up And Ask For Help

When you search online for more than 15 minutes and get no relevant result, you might be asking the wrong questions. If you spend more than an hour trying to solve a problem using online sources and nothing works, it might be useful to ask a friend, a supervisor, or collaborator.

### What Will be covered

Our focus in this five-day bootcamp is to learn how to use [gwdg Jupyter-cloud](https://jupyter-cloud.gwdg.de/welcome/) as your primary analytical tool (but you can also use your own computer and I wont tell). The first day of this class will cover how to set up your environment and how to manage your filesystem in Bash. You will also learn how to use Markdown to write text, and you will be given additional resources to help you with your self-learning. Day two and three is dedicated to Vanilla Python. The fourth day will cover Numpy, the de-facto standard for numerical analysis in Python and Pandas, a tool useful for working with tabular datasets and more. The final part of the week will be devoted to Data Visualisation theory and practice.

## Boot Camp Schedule

|Date    | Times    | Topic    | Description   |
|-----------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
|30-05-2022| 09:00 - 12:00   | Setting the Python environment | This day is all about learning to setup your scientific computational environment - It will cover basics such as terminal control, git and GitHub basics and more   |
|31-05-2022| 09:00 - 12:00   | Python Basics 101 | This day is about getting familiar with Pythons basic elements, the basic data types, data structures, what is a variable and how to create a simple program in Python  |
|01-06-2022| 09:00 - 12:00   | Python Basics 102 | This day is about more advance usage of Python. We will cover using functions, modules and classes and touch about more advanced usage of Anaconda   |
|02-06-2022| 09:00 - 12:00   | Scientific computations using Python | This day will go over the two central packages (i.e. Numpy and Pandas) in the Python ecosystem to control and manipulate datasets on different scales  |
|03-06-2022| 09:00 - 12:00   | Scientific data visualisation using Python | This day will go over concepts and practicalities of exploring and communicating findings using data visualisations in Python  |


## Finally this course is just the tip of the iceberg 
The field of data science is constantly evolving, and this course is designed to further your understanding of the terminology and provide guidance for your PhD journey, but you will find many resources available to help you along your journey. In addition, some of them are free to use because of the open source nature of the field.
I am listing a few links to some of the good free sources that are more extensive naturally.
