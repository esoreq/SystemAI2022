### What is Data Science?

Neuroscience discovery and application rely on the ability to manage and extract insights from big data sets. The process used to get these insights is referred to as data science.

Data science is becoming an increasingly important ability in neuroscience. Single-cell recordings, local field potentials, EEG, and fMRI data are complicated and multidimensional. Understanding, manipulating, and visualising the structure of these complicated information is a critical ability for conducting the research. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious that very big data sets, frequently created cooperatively by several labs, are required to generate meaningful predictions regarding neuroscientific processes. Making inferences is also dependent on computational models, which are methods of recognising and describing patterns in data. While some of these may be recognised from statistics class, a diverse set of statistical and machine learning models is now routinely used in neuroscience.

#### Is data science just a fancy way of saying statistics?

While data science and statistics are topics that overlap, statistics is generally focused on the process of testing hypotheses based on data. More broadly, data science encompasses the storage, management, visualisation, filtering, and preparation of data that is typically required prior to statistical analysis. Data science also includes statistics and machine learning; whereas statistics normally entails drawing inferences from existing data, machine learning entails creating predictions from a data set that will generalise to other data.

Data science incorporates additional exploratory approaches. Statistics are a natural technique to obtaining meaning from data in experimentally oriented areas such as psychology and neuroscience. This is because data is often derived from trials in which specific factors were systematically and purposefully controlled. A good experiment is hypothesis-driven, which means that the researcher anticipates how the data will systematically vary as a result of the experimental manipulations. These predictions are typically based on previous experimental findings or models of the process under investigation. Statistics are fundamentally embedded in data science — indeed, the concept of "data science" as a discipline emerged from the field of statistics — but data science can be viewed as a broader set of practises that includes statistics, machine learning, data cleaning and transformations, and visualisation. Many of these methods are exploratory rather than hypothesis-driven. That is, rather than looking for a specific, predicted pattern, the data scientist investigates the data to discover systematic patterns.
