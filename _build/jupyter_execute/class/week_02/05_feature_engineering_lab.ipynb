    "- It is important to identify the processes that underlays the reasons for missingness in the dataset. \n",

    "  - Missing Completely at Random : no relationship between the data missing and any other values\n",
    "  - Missing at Random : Depends on observed Predictors\n",
    "  - Missing Not At Random : Depends on Unobserved Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Completely at Random\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. \n",
    "- There is **nothing systematic going on** that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n",
    "- If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would not bias the inferences made.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing at Random\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing as Random (MAR) occurs when **there is a systematic relationship** between the propensity of missing values and the observed data. \n",
    "- In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset), but not on the variable itself.\n",
    "- For example, if people from african ethnicity are less likely to allow their financial status to be captured on internet databases compared to european ones, ethnicity is associated with financial status. \n",

    "- Missingness depends on information that has not been recorded, and this information also predicts the missing values.\n",
