    "## Ten simple rules for reproducible research\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #1 - DATA CURATION\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.pickpik.com/photos/110/568/870/files-ddr-archive-preview.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- FOR EVERY RESULT, KEEP TRACK OF HOW IT WAS PRODUCED\n",
    "- Knowing how you went from the raw data to the conclusion allows you to:\n",
    "  - defend the results\n",
    "  - update the results if errors are found\n",
    "  - reproduce the results when data is updated\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #2 - AUTOMATE\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.pickpik.com/photos/373/813/306/heavy-hard-work-hard-work-preview.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- AVOID MANUAL DATA MANIPULATION STEPS\n",
    "- Sometimes it is far easier to open data files in an editor (did anyone say excel?) and manually clean up a couple of formatting errors or remove an outlier.\n",
    "- It is also easy to cut and paste between applications.\n",
    "- This temptation to use manual work instead of scripting should be resisted.\n",
    "- Manual data manipulation is hidden manipulation (violates rule 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #3 - TRACK EXTERNAL VERSIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://p0.piqsels.com/preview/60/688/850/business-office-graphic-designer-planning-thumbnail.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARCHIVE THE EXACT VERSIONS OF ALL EXTERNAL PROGRAMS USED\n",
    "- Document the edition and version of all the software used\n",
    "- Operating system used\n",
    "- Hardware in special cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #4 - TRACK INTERNAL EVOLUTION\n",
    "![](https://blog.k.io/attachment/f1224b44-d27f-4e45-8a49-47fb68f9c862/thumb1400.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- VERSION CONTROL ALL CUSTOM SCRIPTS\n",
    "- A version control system, (e.g. Git), should be used to track the evolution of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #5 - STORE DATA STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*SwXkSz05zb7_kCPQ4dhPug.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RECORD ALL INTERMEDIATE RESULTS, WHEN POSSIBLE IN STANDARDIZED FORMATS\n",
    "- In principle, as long as you kept raw data, all intermediate steps can also be recreated\n",
    "- In practice, some intermediate results are useful at least at the exploratory stage of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #6 - STORE DATA SEEDS\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*M70VAAHkWsq23ifZLIVpLw.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- FOR ANALYSES THAT INCLUDE RANDOMNESS, NOTE UNDERLYING RANDOM SEEDS\n",
    "- Almost all machine learning algorithms have some stochastic element\n",
    "- This is also central for non parametric analysis\n",
    "- Even if your robust results are statistically reproducible, being able to reproduce the exact numbers produced by someone else - is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #7 - STORE SUMMARY TABLES\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*M70VAAHkWsq23ifZLIVpLw.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ALWAYS STORE RAW DATA BEHIND PLOTS\n",
    "- Automatically generate plots using code!!!\n",
    "- Figures will constantly change up until you present results.\n",
    "- If raw data is accessible, you can just change how you communicate it instead of what you communicate.\n",
    "- This is also a good habit to have when working with someone else\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #8 - RECREATE THE RABBIT HOLE\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://c1.wallpaperflare.com/preview/331/516/975/water-plant-green-fine-layers.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- GENERATE HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS OUTPUT, ALLOWING LAYERS OF INCREASING DETAIL TO BE INSPECTED\n",
    "- As scientists, our goal is to summarize results in some form.\n",
    "- That is a key step in communicating results.\n",
    "- However, summarizing data involves losing information\n",
    "- It is also an easy way to misuse data\n",
    "- For each summary result, have a link to the data used to calculate the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #9 - LINK EVERYTHING\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/f3/81/a0f381ead8a60dfe88bbf1ddc414708b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- CONNECT TEXTUAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERLYING RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data analysis results are commonly presented as a report containing words and images.\n",
    "- The link between analysis and interpretations is not always straight forward.\n",
    "- Therefore itâ€™s essential that the report of a study be linked back to the results.\n",
    "- And because of Rule #1, all the way back to the raw data.\n",
    "- This can be achieved, by using a computational notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### RULE #10 - BE TRANSPARENT\n",
    "![](https://p1.piqsels.com/preview/915/529/243/keyboard-button-key-entering-input-internet.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS TO SCRIPTS, RUNS, AND RESULTS\n",
    "- Open version control systems, such as GitLab and GitHub, allow the creation of both private and public repositories\n",
    "- Private repositories can be accessed by authorized colleagues.\n",
    "- public repositories can be accessed by anyone with a computer.\n",
    "- More eyes on your analysis leads to less mistakes\n",
    "- So the more you share, the better your analyses are likely to be."
