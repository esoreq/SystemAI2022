# ## DAY 02 - HOMEWORK 
# 
# - Solve as many of the exercises below 

# ### Exercise 1
# - Extract the second and middle element from the list below
# 
# ~~~python
# L = list(range(10,90,5))
# # your solution goes here 
# second = ?
# middle = ?
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 2
# - Using indexing extract the following sequence from the list L 
# ~~~python
# L = list(range(10,90,5))
# seq = [40,50,60]
# # your solution goes here 
# sub_seq = ? 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 3
# - Using one line of code count the number of unique words in this [story](http://fiftywordstories.com/2022/02/09/michelle-wilson-hoarder-s8-e5/)
# ~~~python
# story = """'There`s safety in things,' the therapist explains, noting mile-high clothing, bric-a-brac, and boxes.
#             They won`t abandon you like the husband who vanished eight years ago. 
#             You’re filling the void with objects that can`t love you.
#             But he`s wrong. The thing in the basement corner loves me.
# 
#             When I feed him."""
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 4
# - Using the same story print out only the words that are repeated 
# - For an extra challenge try to do this with one line also 
# ~~~python
# story = """'There`s safety in things,' the therapist explains, noting mile-high clothing, bric-a-brac, and boxes.
#             They won`t abandon you like the husband who vanished eight years ago. 
#             You’re filling the void with objects that can`t love you.
#             But he`s wrong. The thing in the basement corner loves me.
# 
#             When I feed him."""
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 4
# - Using the same story create a dictionary that contains the following:
#   - A unique numeric index
#   - The number of word occurrence in the story 
#   - The number of characters has
# - For an extra challenge try to do this with one line also 
# ~~~python
# story = """'There`s safety in things,' the therapist explains, noting mile-high clothing, bric-a-brac, and boxes.
#             They won`t abandon you like the husband who vanished eight years ago. 
#             You’re filling the void with objects that can`t love you.
#             But he`s wrong. The thing in the basement corner loves me.
# 
#             When I feed him."""
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 5
# - Create the multiplication matrix for 1-13 
# - So that the cell with index 2,3 will be $3x4=12$
# - For an extra challenge try to do this with one line
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 6
# - Now create the power matrix for 1-6 
# - So that the cell in 3,4 will be $4^5=1024$
# - For an extra challenge try to do this with one line
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 7
# - Now create the power matrix for 1-6 
# - So that the cell in 3,4 will be $4^5=1024$
# - For an extra challenge try to do this with one line
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 8
# - Using steps of 46 and starting from 25 and ending with 163, print out a sequence of strings that begins with the word Week (e.g. Week_025, … , Week_163) and is on the same line separated by commas.
# 
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 9 
# - For all the numbers from 1 to 15 (including) print the number a comma and if they are odd,(O) or even (E).
# - So the sequence will begin with the following `1-O,2-E,3-O`
# 
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 10 
# - Using the following sequence `abCdEFGHjd0rG` print out if a single character is UPPER (U) or lower (l) case
# - So the sequence will begin with the following `a-l,b-l,C-U`
# 
# ~~~python
# seq = "abCdEFGHjd0rG"
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 11 
# - Using one of the following quotes
#   - "People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day."
#   - "The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time."
#   - "The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."
# - And using a for loop print **on the same line** the same sentence with underscores instead of spaces    
# 
# ~~~python
# sen1 = "People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day."
# sen2 = "The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time."
# sen3 = "The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits."
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~

# ### Exercise 12 
# - Using the same quote print each word independently stacked
# - So for sentence 01 your output will look like this
#   - People
#   - say
#   - ...
#   - day.
# 
# ~~~python
# # your solution goes here 
# ~~~
