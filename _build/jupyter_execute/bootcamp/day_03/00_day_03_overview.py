# # DAY 03 - Programming 101
# 
# ### What is Programming?
# - Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.
# - “Instruct the computer”: this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instructions could be of various types.
# 
# ### Why would we automate tasks using Programming
# - Humans and computers environments revolve around the symbols we use to communicate and be communicated to. 
# - Computers' consistency, precision, and speed make them good at things we can't or wouldn't accomplish. 
# - If we want to reduce errors, repeated, tedious tasks should also be done by a computer. 
# - Humans hate repeated work. They're usually boring and uninteresting. 
# - We prefer being pushed and rewarded for doing complicated and creative tasks that build our talents. 
# - For example, we don't like to do calculation on a spreadsheet. 
# 
# ### How would we automate things using Programming
# - In most cases it's just a matter of breaking the process that needs to be automated to general bits 
# - As a rule of thumb if you find yourself copying and pasting a piece of code more than twice it's a hint that you should convert it into a function 
# 
# ### What this module will cover
# - Today's main objective is to familiarize you with how to use Python to automate stuff.
# - We will start by looking into what are functions and how we can use them 
# - Then go over the idea of a module or package as a way of sharing, and storing functions that are useful 
# - Cover how to use magic commands in Jupyter to improve our workflow with modules and functions
# - And end with the notion of classes in Python and how we can extend functions to create an object armed with methods
