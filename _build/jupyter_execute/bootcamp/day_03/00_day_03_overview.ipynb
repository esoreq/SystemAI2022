    "# DAY 03 - Programming with Python \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Programming?\n",
    "- Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.\n",
    "- “Instruct the computer”: this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instructions could be of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would we automate tasks using Programming\n",
    "- Humans and computers environments revolve around the symbols we use to communicate and be communicated to. \n",
    "- Computers' consistency, precision, and speed make them good at things we can't or wouldn't accomplish. \n",
    "- If we want to reduce errors, repeated, tedious tasks should also be done by a computer. \n",
    "- Humans hate repeated work. They're usually boring and uninteresting. \n",
    "- We prefer being pushed and rewarded for doing complicated and creative tasks that build our talents. \n",
    "- For example, we don't like to do calculation on a spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How would we automate things using Programming\n",
    "- In most cases it's just a matter of breaking the process that needs to be automated to general bits \n",
    "- As a rule of thumb if you find yourself copying and pasting a piece of code more than twice it's a hint that you should convert it into a function \n",
    "\n",
    "## What this module will cover\n",
    "- Today's main objective is to familiarize you with how to use Python to automate stuff.\n",
    "- We will start by looking into what are functions and how we can use them \n",
    "- Then go over the idea of a module or package as a way of sharing, and storing functions that are useful \n",
    "- Cover how to use magic commands in Jupyter to improve our workflow with modules and functions\n",
    "- And end with the notion of classes in Python and how we can extend functions to create an object armed with methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links to expand your understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested in learning more...\n",
