# # DAY 05 - Data visualisation
# 
# 
# ## What is data visualisation
# 
# - Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. 
# - By using visual elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see, understand and communicate trends, outliers and patterns in data.
# - In the world of big data, data visualisation tools and technologies are essential for analysing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions.
# - This session is about mastering static plots 
# - We will cover interactive and statistical plots throughout the course 
# 
# 
# ## Why do we need different types of data visualisation modules?
# - Python contains many different visualisation packages each revolving around a core framework and is developed to address either specialised needs or limitations of the other current frameworks. 
# - This image is by no mean a complete list but just a peak into a complex ecosystem

# 
# ## What is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
# - In Python, Matplotlib is the "grandfather" of data visualization. 
# - It was created to try and replicate MATLAB's plotting capabilities with Python. 
# - It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for creating reproducible publication ready scientific figures.
#  
# - Some of the major Pros of Matplotlib are:
#   * Simple plots are generally easy to create
#   * Each element in the figure is nicely controlled
#   * A variety of output formats with high quality
# 
# ## What is [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html)
# - Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. 
# - It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.
# - Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. 
# - Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. 
# - Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.
# 
# ## What is [plotly](https://plotly.com/)
# - Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. 
# - It is built on top of d3.js and stack.gl, Plotly is a high-level, declarative charting library. 
# - Plotly's open-source graphing libraries are free to use, work offline and don't require any account registration.
